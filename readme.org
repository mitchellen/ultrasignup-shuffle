** Summary 
Trying to create models to better guess the ranking for future races.

  - [] Create a function to scrape previous editons of the race. Make sure to job past racer data at the event date to keep from skewing the data. Use that data to train a model.
  - [ ] Randomize strings into integers
  - [ ] Make sure all conversion functions are correct
  - [ ] Run a test on a future race
